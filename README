SYNOPSIS
        use Math::PSNR;

            }
        );

        # Calculate MSE
        $psnr->mse;

        # Calculate PSNR
        $psnr->psnr;

        # Access to member variable of x
        $psnr->x(
            {
                r => [ 1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5 ],

                b => [ 1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5 ],
            }
        );

        # Access to member variable of y
        $psnr->y(

                r => [ 9.9, 8.8, 7.7, 6.6, 5.5 ],
                g => [ 9.9, 8.8, 7.7, 6.6, 5.5 ],
                b => [ 9.9, 8.8, 7.7, 6.6, 5.5 ],
            }
        );

        # Calculate MSE of three components signal (e.g. RGB image)

DESCRIPTION
    This module calculates PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ration) and MSE (Mean
    Square Error).

    PSNR and MSE are the index of measuring quality between different
    signals. They are commonly used to evaluate quality of images.

    This module can deal with single component signals (e.g. monochrome
    image) and three components signals (e.g. color (RGB) image).

    More examples are in my GitHub repository.

INTERFACES
  "Math::PSNR->new( bpp => $bpp, x => $x, y => $y )"
    Creates an instance. Attributes are as follows:

   "bpp"
    Specify the bpp (bit per pixel). It sets 2^(bpp) - 1 to maximum power
    ("maximum power" means maximum allowable value of signal).

    "is : rw"
        This attribute is rewritable. Default accessor to this attribute is
        provided.

    "isa : Int"
        Please specify value of this attribute as integer.

    "default : 8"
        This attribute has default value. If *bpp* is not specified, it will
        be set 8 (bit).

    "required : 0"
        You do not have to set value of this attribute at constructor.

   "x"
    One side of signal for calculate PSNR and MSE.

    "is : rw"
        This attribute is rewritable. Default accessor to this attribute is
        provided.

    "isa : ArrayRef|HashRef"
        Please specify value of this attribute as numerical array reference
        or hash reference.

    "required : 1"
        You must set value of this attribute at constructor.

   "y"
    Another signal for calculate PSNR or MSE.

    "is : rw"
        This attribute is rewritable. Default accessor to this attribute is
        provided.

    "isa : ArrayRef|HashRef"
        Please specify value of this attribute as numerical array reference
        or hash reference.

    "required : 1"
        You must set value of this attribute at constructor.

METHODS
    "mse"
        This function calculates and returns MSE of single component signal.
        This function requires values of attribute *x* and *y* that is
        numerical array reference. Signal (array) length of *x* and *y* must
        be the same.

    "psnr"
        This function calculates and returns PSNR of single component
        signal. This function requires values of attribute *x* and *y* that
        is numerical array reference. Signal (array) length of *x* and *y*
        must be the same.

    "mse_rgb"
        This function calculates and returns MSE of three components (RGB)
        signal. This function requires values of attribute *x* and *y* that
        is hash reference. Those hash references must have three components
        (keys of hash are 'r', 'g', and 'b'). Signal length of each
        components (keys) of *x* and *y* must be the same.

    "psnr_rgb"
        This function calculates and returns PSNR of three components
        signal. This function requires values of attribute *x* and *y* that
        is hash reference. Those hash references must have three components
        (keys of hash are 'r', 'g', and 'b'). Signal length of each
        components (keys) of *x* and *y* must be the same.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
    Math::PSNR requires no configuration files or environment variables.
